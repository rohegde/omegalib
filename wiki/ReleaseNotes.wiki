= omegalib v1.0 =
*Initial Revision*: 965
*Branch-out Revision*: 1035
== Summary ==
	This is the first "official" version of the omegalib (and omicron) APIs. The project has been deeply refactored into a set of well-separated modules:
		* `omicron`: lives an external project, and contains all the event services code, input device support, plus various utility classes.
		* `omega`: contains most of the dispaly system support code, plus a lightweight rendering system that allows building applications that distribute rendering on multiple gpus / machine nodes.
		* `omegaToolkit`: contains a set of utility classes that simplify the developement of graphical applications (i.e. mesh loading and rendering, gui support). `omegaToolkit` is used mainly by the demo applications included with omega. Most of the code inside `omegaToolkit` should be considered experimental and is not part of the stable API.
		* `omegaOsg`: contains classes that integrate OpenSceneGraph wwith omegalib. omegaOsg deeply simplifies the conversion of existing osg programs into virtual relity applications running on top of omegalib.
		Like previous versions, omegalib has no external dependencies, and compiles out-of-the-box. Required third party packages are either included as binary downloadables or as source code, and compile / link automatically as part of the omegalib build process.
== Change Log ==

	* Scale in controller, new define in ObserverUpdateService
	* NEW: ControllerManipulator
	* NEW: Added controller support for NetService.
	* NEW: Experimental zoom gesture added to NetService to eventually replace PQ gestures.
	* NEW: started working on material effects for hplviewer
	* CHANGE: removed support for background gradients in oengine (2d drawing cannot be done correctly interlaced mode). Substituted by simple color clear buffer in equalizer channels.
	* NEW: Engine background support, hplviewer uses internal obj viewer now
	* CHANGE: camera support focus change, hpl work with planes
	* NEW: added osgWorks
	* CHANGE: camera mouse movement using mouse buttons
	* NEW: tinyxml, hplviewer, new interaction in nightfield
	* UPDATE: OmegaControllerScript updated to use new Wiimote datagram (battery,IR, MotionPlus moved to its own controller type) FIX: InputServiceScript no longer give warning about TouchListener (TouchListener tag will be removed soon) 
	* TabletService fixed rotation and pinch gesture abstraction to mouse
	* CHANGE: camera move up support + osgviewer working again
	* NEW: camera scale support
	* NEW: Camera navigation
	* NEW: NeuroSky Unity example added.
	* Generalized TCPClient and made a specialized TCPClientOmega.  Setup simple delegation btn DetailVC and FIA.  Need to pipe all networking msgs through this delegate next.
	* NEW: on-screen console
	* CHANGE: fixes / changes to engine to make osg rendering work.
	* NEW: download linux binaries for openscenegraph
	* CHANGE: osg binary packages are now in googlecode download page.

	* NEW: nightfield uses oengine and custom renderables now (multigpu support)
	* NEW: ThinkGearService and Brain events. 
	* UPDATED: Update intervals for VRPN and ThinkGear are handled in their respective config setting rather than by oinputserver. By default oinputserver streams as fast as possible.
