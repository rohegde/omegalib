= omegalib v3.0 =
*Initial Revision*: 1839
*Branch-out Revision*: 2233
== Summary ==
	Omegalib 3.0 is a major improvement over the 2.0 distribution. It is the version used on the first public demos of the [http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&type=1&indi=424 CAVE2] virtual reality system. It greatly improves performance and stability on cluster display systems, and integrates an extended python API for application developement.
	C++ and Python omegalib applications can now be accessed in the [https://code.google.com/p/omegalib-apps/ omegalib applications repository].
	omegalib 3.0 also integrates a new version of [PortholeReference Porthole].

= omegalib v2.0 =
*Initial Revision*: 1306
*Branch-out Revision*: 1627
== Summary ==
	Omegalib 2.0 is a big improvement over 1.0, both feature and API-wise. This is the first version thoroughly tested on a clustered display system. OpenSceneGraph support has been deeply improved, and the Cyclops toolkit is now offered as a library, allowing simplified developement of omegalib/osg applications. Other changes include:
	  * *a revision of Vtk support* (now integrated in the omegVtk library). Vtk integration works correctly in a clustered environment
	  * Improved support for gamepad / wand camera navigation and object control
	  * Support for *3d user interfaces*
	  * The *Cyclops toolkit* support for:
	     * Loading of custom scenes from XML files
		 * Animated models
		 * Customized shader-based materials and effects
		 * osg-based soft shadowing
	  * OpenScenegraph support for *all major image formats* (through a custom FreeImage plugin) and the industry standard *Fbx format*.
	  * A *menu-based user interface API* (`MenuManager`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`)
	  * A *python interactive console* and support for *python ui event handlers*
	  * *Simplified definition of display configs* though an automated Equalizer configuration generator: Users can now define the display configuration using a simpler format inside system config files. omegalib will parse and convert the configuration to the Equalizer format, removing a lot of redundant and error-prone manual steps.

= omegalib v1.0 =
*Initial Revision*: 965
*Branch-out Revision*: 1302
== Summary ==
	This is the first "official" version of the omegalib (and omicron) APIs. The project has been deeply refactored into a set of well-separated modules:
		* `omicron`: lives an external project, and contains all the event services code, input device support, plus various utility classes.
		* `omega`: contains most of the dispaly system support code, plus a lightweight rendering system that allows building applications that distribute rendering on multiple gpus / machine nodes.
		* `omegaToolkit`: contains a set of utility classes that simplify the developement of graphical applications (i.e. mesh loading and rendering, gui support). `omegaToolkit` is used mainly by the demo applications included with omega. Most of the code inside `omegaToolkit` should be considered experimental and is not part of the stable API.
		* `omegaOsg`: contains classes that integrate OpenSceneGraph wwith omegalib. omegaOsg deeply simplifies the conversion of existing osg programs into virtual relity applications running on top of omegalib.
		Like previous versions, omegalib has no external dependencies, and compiles out-of-the-box. Required third party packages are either included as binary downloadables or as source code, and compile / link automatically as part of the omegalib build process.
