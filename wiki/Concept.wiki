Inside Omegalib, hardware abstraction is implemented through two concepts: display system abstraction and input system abstraction.

== Display System Abstraction ==
Omegalib manages rendering using the concept of display systems: A display system takes care of setting up the graphical hardware system, creating windows and viewports, setting up transformations and rendering pipelines and calling the appropriate application-level rendering functions. Currently, two display systems have been implemented: a simple GLUT based display system used mainly for debug purposes, and an Equalizer based display system.
