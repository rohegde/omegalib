= Configuration file types =
Omegalib applications are usually based on two distints configuation files: the *system configuration file* and the *application configuration file*.

The system configuration file determines the properties of the system the application will run on such as:
    * What input devices are available and how they are to be set up
	* The resolution of displays, their geometry, and network configuration for cluster systems
	* The defaults for observer position, navigation styles and interaction keymappings
Examples for several different system configuration files can be found in the `data/system` folder.
	
The application configuration file contains application-specific options, as determined by the application itself. See the `Config` class reference for more information on how to read configuration values. The simplest possible application configuration file is:
<code language="c">
	config:
	{
		systemConfig = "system/desktop.cfg";
	};
</code>
This application configuration specifies no option other than which system configuration file to use (in this case, `system/desktop.cfg`)

= Configuration file syntax =
Configuration files follow the syntax of libconfig. Here is an example of a complete system configuration file for reference.
<code language="c">
	config:
	{
		display:
		{
			type = "Equalizer";
			geometry = "ConfigPlanar";
			numTiles = [1, 1];
			referenceTile = [0, 0];
			referenceOffset = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0];
			tileSize = [1.2, 0.8];
			autoOffsetWindows = true;
			windowOffset = [200, 200];
			tileResolution = [854, 480];
			interleaved = false;
			fullscreen = false;
			tiles:
			{
				local:
				{
					t0x0: {};
				};
			};
			observers:
			{
				observer0:
				{
					position = [ 0.0,  0.0,  1.0 ];
				};
			};
		};
		input:
		{
			MouseService: {};
			KeyboardService: {};
			ViewRayService:
			{
				inputService="MouseService";
				//inputService="SagePointerService";
				hasNormalizedInput = false;
			};
		};
		defaultFont:
		{
			filename = "fonts/segoeuimod.ttf";
			size = 24;
		};
		camera:
		{
			controller ="KeyboardMouse";
		};
		interactor:
		{
			style = "Mouse";
		};
		menu3dEnabled = true;
		pythonShellEnabled = true;
	};
</code>

= Loading configuration files =
By default, applications try to open an application configuration file with the application name and a `cfg` extension. If not found, the library will search for `default.cfg`. The default configuration file can be changed by passing a different file as the first argument to an omegalib application.
