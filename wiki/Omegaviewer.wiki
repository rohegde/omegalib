#summary Developement proposal and design for omegaviewer
This document contains the omegaviewer application concept, timeline and developement notes.

= Omegaviewer: Meshviewer on steroids =
Omegaviewer will use meshviewer as a starting point but allow users to interact with the applications in a more advanced way
  * The application will support free viewpoint definition and navigation using controllers
  * The application will allow users to interact with objects through a tablet interface
  
== Tablet interaction ==
The tablet will offer a dynamic, ad hoc UI that will depend on the currently active object. Different object will offer different customization / interaction options.

The tablet can also be used to define the object transformation though gestures:
 * single finger moving: object translation on the x, y plane *with respect to the user viewpoint*
 * two finger pushing  in the z direction *with respect to the user viewpoint*
 * rotation (?)
 * pinch zoom to scale the object.
