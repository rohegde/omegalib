Once all the components are gathered:

# Using the chosen SVN client checkout a version from Google Code.
# Open the cmake gui
   * Set source_path to where OmegaLib source was placed at checkout
   * Set build_path to ./source_Path/build.
   * Configure
   * Choose version of Visual Studio installed
   * Generate
# Go into ./source_Path/build directory open .snl using Visual Studio
   * Need to assign otest as startup project by right clicking on otest in solution view
   * Set the debug path
