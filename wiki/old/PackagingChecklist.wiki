#sidebar Sidebar
This is the current way of creating an omegalib distribution package. Hopefully will become obsolete in the future when we'll start using CPack.
This document is mostly for internal use. 

= How to Package omegalib =
  * create folder with version name - config - os
    * config can be
      * `zero` for versions with just netservice
	  * `lite` for versions with omega only
	  * `` (nothing) for versions with omega and oengine
	  * `full` for versions with all the integration libraries enabled
  * copy UseOmegalib.cmake from binary distribution to package root dir.
  * copy include dir from binary distribution
  * copy bin dir from binary distribution
  * cleanup bin dir
    * in debug, delete all ilk files
  * copy lib dir from binary distribution
  * svn export include dir from source distribution
  * svn export data dir from source distribution
  * cleanup data dir
    * for lite builds, just keep system
	* for normal builds keep everything except for osg, vtk, ui
  * svn export CMakeModules
  * svn export tutorials
