This page offers extended information on how to develop applications for omegalib.

== Omegalib Binaries ==
Currently, precompiled versions of omegalib are available for windows only. You can compile your own version of omegalib on linux or osx (no python support at the moment, sorry) following the instructions further down on this page.

=== Major releases ===
