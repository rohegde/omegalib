The code presented is a simplified version of the osgviewer demo (omegaSource/src/apps/osgviewer). The actual demo code is a little more complex than this, and does a few additional things like adding a bounding box around the model, loading a mesh from a configuration file and enabling object interaction through scene node attachments. We won't discuss these details in this page and just concentrate on the basic functionality of the application, step by step.
