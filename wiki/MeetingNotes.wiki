=OmegaLib Meeting Notes=

==January 19 2011==
* Alessandro:
 * added a bunch of utility classes for math & geometry to omegalib


==November 10 2010==
 * Alessandro: Compile without Equalizer support, needed in about a week.
 * Brad needs to compile omegalib inside linux, hopefully be solved by disabling equalizer  support and compiling a dependency free version of the lib.
 * Brad: put updated version of mocap config in repository
 * Brad & Arthur: think about porting their unity animation app (awesome ants) to omegadesk as a demo app using multitouch + 3d.
 * Khairi mentioned using omegalib in future version of raintable for multitouch (they may be using PQLab overlays)
 * Brad: need to have 2 tracked hands.

==October 6 2010==
 * Arthur: Omegalib NetService & oinputserver working
 * Alessandro: tested vtk demo on new omegadesk. Still have to get active stereo working (Equalizer problem?)
 * Next week: merging 0.2 and 0.3
 * Test app: build a simple obj mesh viewer
