=OmegaLib Meeting Notes=

==February 9 2011==
 * (*Victor*) still working on Kinect integration. Should be ready in a couple weeks
 * (*Arthur*) working on xbox360 & ps3 controller integration
 * (*Alessandro*) meshviewer app: started integration with omegadesk inputs & working on UI lib


==January 19 2011==
 * (*Alessandro*) added a bunch of utility classes for math & geometry to omegalib
 * (*Alessandro*) working on meshviewer application
 * (*Victor*) integrating kinect into omegalib
 * (*Arthur*) start thinking on how to integrate controller support into omegalib
 * Other issues / questions:
  * Having multiple thread render 2d / 3d portions of the screen to keep speed of 2d and 3d parts separate
  * Do we need optitrack for controller tracking or can we use kinect for everything?
  * Do kinect and optitrack interfere?
  * Are we able to render full res active stereo on the omegadesk machine? (Looks like we can't with the current video card)


==November 10 2010==
 * Alessandro: Compile without Equalizer support, needed in about a week.
 * Brad needs to compile omegalib inside linux, hopefully be solved by disabling equalizer  support and compiling a dependency free version of the lib.
 * Brad: put updated version of mocap config in repository
 * Brad & Arthur: think about porting their unity animation app (awesome ants) to omegadesk as a demo app using multitouch + 3d.
 * Khairi mentioned using omegalib in future version of raintable for multitouch (they may be using PQLab overlays)
 * Brad: need to have 2 tracked hands.

==October 6 2010==
 * Arthur: Omegalib NetService & oinputserver working
 * Alessandro: tested vtk demo on new omegadesk. Still have to get active stereo working (Equalizer problem?)
 * Next week: merging 0.2 and 0.3
 * Test app: build a simple obj mesh viewer
