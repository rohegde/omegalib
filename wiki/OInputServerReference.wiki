#summary Documentation of OInputServer and NetService datagrams.

= Introduction =

Datagram Structure:
'{Service Type}:{Event Type},{Source ID},{Param1},...,{ParamN} '

Number of parameters depend on the service type. Note the trailing space at the end of the datagram. Source ID is a unique identifier for that touch, rigid body, controller, etc. Service and event types are described below.

= Service Types =

Each service type is defined by an enumeration. The types currently used by oinputserver are listed below. A full list can be found in Service.h.

0: Pointer

1: Mocap

3: Controller

== Pointer Datagram ==

There are three kinds of pointer datagrams: mouse, touch point, and touch gesture.

=== <u> Mouse </u> ===
'0:{Event ID},{Source ID},{X Position},{Y Position} '


=== <u> Touch Point </u> ===
'0:{Event ID},{Source ID},{X Position},{Y Position},{X Width},{Y Width} '

=== <u> Touch Gestures </u> ===
Touch gestures parameters depend on the event type. See Event ID Types below for a listing of all event types.

==== Touch Down / Move / Up / Click / Move ====
This applies for Click, DoubleClick, MoveRight, MoveUp, MoveLeft, and MoveDown.

'0:{Event ID},{X Position},{Y Position} '

==== SplitStart / SplitEnd ====
Denotes the beginning or end of a two finger split/zoom gesture and lists the coordinates of each finger. X3 and Y3 are the midpoints of position 1 and 2.

'0:{Event ID},{Source ID},{X3 Position},{Y3 Position},{X2 Position},{Y2 Position},{X1 Position},{Y1 Position} '

==== Split ====
A two finger split/zoom gesture. Lists the coordinates of each finger, delta distance, and delta ratio. X3 and Y3 are the midpoints of position 1 and 2.

'0:{Event ID},{Source ID},{X3 Position},{Y3 Position},{X2 Position},{Y2 Position},{X1 Position},{Y1 Position},{Delta distance},{Delta ratio} '

==== Rotate Start/End ====
Denotes the start/end of a two finger rotation gesture. One finger (anchor) is stationary while the other rotates around it. The X,Y position is the center of rotation/anchor.

'0:{Event ID},{X Position},{Y Position},{Anchor X},{Anchor Y},{Rotating X},{Rotating Y} '

==== Rotate ====
A two finger rotation gesture. One finger (anchor) is stationary while the other rotates around it. The X,Y position is the center of rotation/anchor. Angle is in radians.

'0:{Event ID},{Source ID},{X Position},{Y Position},{Anchor X},{Anchor Y},{Rotating X},{Rotating Y},{Angle} '

----

== Mocap Datagram ==

'1:{Source ID},{X Position},{Y Position},{Z Position},{X Rotation},{Y Rotation},{Z Rotation} '

----

== Controller Datagram ==

Controller datagrams depend of the controller type: Xbox 360, PS3, Wiimote.

'2:{Source ID} '
