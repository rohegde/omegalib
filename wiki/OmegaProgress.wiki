#summary This page is a pseudo blog of what progress is being made on OmegaLib.

= omegalib v?.? (*far future plans go here*) =
 * omegalib / Vtk integration?


= omegalib v0.3 (*near future plans go here*) =
 * omegalib / Ogre integration?
 * omegalib >> Processing.
 * support linux builds (i386 only for now)


= omegalib v0.2 (*delivery*: when it's ready) =

==<u> Dennis </u>== 
 * Convert oTest to oDemo (*DONE*)
 * Documentation for Cristian and Shannon (optiTrack support) (*DONE*)
 * Add to concepts page
 
==<u> Alessandro </u>==
 * Configuration system support (*done*)
  Omega applications should be set up through configuration files and not through code. Working on config file support. 
    
 * Lay down basic omega utility toolkit (*done*)
  outk will offer some additional functionality to applications that need it (i.e. basic GUI support, a simple graphics library, etc.)

 * Start work on outk GUI system (*delivery*: ?)
  Add a couple of basic GUI widgets
  * Button (*done*)
  * Slider
  * Image

 * Add basic support for Input filter creation (*delivery*: ?)
  Input filters will be used to process and mangle input event coming from services, before they get delivered to an omegalib application. Filters can implement functionalities like noise reduction, improved finger / object tracking and gesture support.
    
 * TacTile integration: cmake setup (*delivery*: ?)
  Implement TacTileService: prepare cmake files for TacTileService integration.

 * x64 support (*delivery*: ?)
 Right now omegalib supports limited x64 builds (i.e. no outk support).
 Make the entire lib support 64bit builds

==<u> Victor </u>==
 * Integrate newest omegalib with PigProject visualization

 * Waiting for:
  * Gestures
  * Rigid body movements (will it work on 64bit?)

==<u> Brad </u>==
 * Reading papers on 3D gesturing and gesture disambiguation.
 
 * Start working on a simple application to have pattern recognition for
   3D gesturing.
  * Going to try to get a wave and a rotate/pivot gesture working first.

==<u> Arthur </u>==
 * Paint 3D teapot by painting 2D texture map via multi-touch (*delivery*: ?)

 * Update PQService to use config files (*done*)

 * Evaluate PQLabs gestures (*done*)
  Determine accuracy and usefulness. Integrate into PQService if so.
  Basic gestures added.

 * oinputservice / NetService implementation (*delivery*: Week of Aug. 30)
  Support streaming of events to remote omegalib instances.

 * Update PQService to stream TUIO format coordinates using screen ratio (*done*)
  Support correct scaling of coordinates on remote omegalib instances which may have a different screen resolution than the omegalib instance running on the server machine.

==<u> Unassigned </u>==
 * TacTile integration (*delivery*: ?)
  Implement TacTileService.
