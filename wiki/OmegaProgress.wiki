#summary This page is a pseudo blog of what progress is being made on OmegaLib.

= omegalib v?.? (*far future plans go here*) =
 * omegalib / Vtk integration?


= omegalib v0.3 (*near future plans go here*) =
 * omegalib / Ogre integration?
 * omegalib >> Processing.
 * support linux builds (i386 only for now)


= omegalib v0.2 (*delivery*: when it's ready) =

==<u> Dennis </u>== 
 * Convert oTest to oDemo (*DONE*)
 * Documentation for Cristian and Shannon (optiTrack support) (*DONE*)

(*delivery*: working on next week)
 * Think about how to integrate touch and gesture to oDemo
  Do some story boards
 * Tweek perspective for oDemo
  Make the stereo look better while keeping depth and proper distortion 
 
==<u> Alessandro </u>==
 * Configuration system support (*done*)
  Omega applications should be set up through configuration files and not through code. Working on config file support. 
    
 * Lay down basic omega utility toolkit (*done*)
  outk will offer some additional functionality to applications that need it (i.e. basic GUI support, a simple graphics library, etc.)

 * Start work on outk GUI system (*delivery*: 25-30July)
  Add a couple of basic GUI widgets
  * Button (*done*)
  * Slider
  * Image

 * Add basic support for Input filter creation (*delivery*: 12-15July)
  Input filters will be used to process and mangle input event coming from services, before they get delivered to an omegalib application. Filters can implement functionalities like noise reduction, improved finger / object tracking and gesture support.
    
 * TacTile integration: cmake setup (*delivery*: ?)
  Implement TacTileService: prepare cmake files for TacTileService integration.

 * x64 support (*delivery*: ?)
 Right now omegalib supports limited x64 builds (i.e. no outk support).
 Make the entire lib support 64bit builds

==<u> Victor </u>==
 * Integrate newest omegalib with PigProject visualization

 * Waiting for:
  * Gestures
  * Rigid body movements (will it work on 64bit?)

==<u> Brad </u>==
 * Getting MoCap driver to read config files. 

 * Always playing with glove/rigid body arrangements.

==<u> Arthur </u>==
 * Paint 3D teapot by painting 2D texture map via multi-touch (*delivery*: ?)

 * Update PQService to use config files (*done*)

 * Evaluate PQLabs gestures (*delivery*: July 13-15)
  Determine accuracy and usefulness. Integrate into PQService if so.

==<u> Jakub </u>==
 * < insert here> 
  <details here>

==<u> Unassigned </u>==
 * TacTile integration (*delivery*: ?)
  Implement TacTileService.
 * oinputservice / NetService implementation (*delivery*: ?)
  Support streaming of events to remote omegalib instances.
