This page contains suggestions, code snippets and tips that are not elaborate enough (yet) to become a full tutorial.

= Building on Visual Studio =
omegalib supports builds in visual studio 2008 and 2010. Both 32 and 64 bit builds should work, but currently only
Visual studio 2010 32 bit builds are tested regularly.

== General Tips & Tricks ==
=== Speeding up builds ===
After the first build, it is possible to speed up successive builds by unloading projects in the 3rdparty folder. These dependencies need to be built only once per configuration, so they can be disabled after the first build. This way, the build system won't have to go through them to check if they are up to date.

== Visual Studio 2010 Notes ==
=== "When building omegalib from scratch with equalizer enabled the build fails with the compiler complaining about not finding `lexer.cpp`" ===
This error is due to some incorrect dependencies in the equalizer project, and visual studio spawning multiple compiler processes on multiprocessor machines. Simply ignore the error and build the solution again. After one-two additional builds the problem should go away. This won't happen anymore, unless you rebuild omegalib from scratch.

=== "When enabling DirectInput support, the build fails because `hidsdi.h` is not found" ===
For DirectInput to work, you have to make sure the Visual Studio compiler searches for DirectInput headers from the windows DDK.

_^Make sure the WinDDK include directory is the first one in the include directories section under Project Options >> Projects and Solutions >> VC++ Directories^_
</p>

=== "The build fails because the equalizer header 'api.h' is noy found" ===
Similar to the 'lexer.cpp' error. Sometimes building again all that is needed to solve the problem. Otherwise, to make sure it goes away, build equalizer separately (see the picture) the do the same for the omega project

=== "In Debug mode the build succeeds but the program will fail running with a 0xc0150002 error" ===
Some of the libraries used internally by omegalib need the Visual Studio 2008 Debug CRT to run.
To solve this issue install Visual C++ Express 2008 (post link)
