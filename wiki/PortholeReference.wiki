omegalib offers support for HTML5-capable browsers interactions. Specifically, the interface is multi-touchable, in order to support most of the hand helded devices, such as iPads, iPhones, Android tablets, and Android smartphones.

If you want your application to expose an interface to all the HTML5-capable browsers, and, in particular, to most of the hand helded devices, you need to provide the following files:

 * A _.xml_ file, that specifies the elements and their disposition for the different types of devices
 * A _.css_ file, that may contain any CSS style you want to apply to the final interface; it is used to tweak the style of the elements, but it may be empty if you are satisfied with the basic style provided
