= New Features =
== NGCave / eqc autoconfig tool (done in 2.0) ==
 * `HorzontalTiles, VerticalTiles` tile count
 * `ReferenceTile(RT)[ix, iy]` index of tile whose center is reference point R
	* NOTE: ReferenceTile normal is always +Z in global reference frame
 * `ReferenceOffset(RO)` offser of R wrt origin of system
 * `TileSize(TS)[w, h]` tile width, height

NOTE, RT corners easy to find.
	(i.e. `RTtl = RO - <-TSw/2, -TSh/2, 0>`)
	
 * `ConfigurationType` [Planar, Cylindrical]
 * `ColumnYawIncrement` angle variation on Y axis between one tile column and next.	Columns left of RT column have positive increment, right have negative.

Output text file:
	`TileIndex[ix, iy] TileCorners[tl, tr, bl, br]`

= Changes =
=== Revise Equalizer display system (done in 2.0) ===
	* There is probably a lot of redundancy in the initialization flow - inefficiency in the current way the Equalizer / application init flow works. Revise it.
	* *?* Render interlaced & side by side directly inside channel render function without relying on equalizer config and multiple equalizer draw calls
		* Would allow to work around some problems with equalizer
		* Would this lead to better performance?
	* create autogenerator of eq configurations using libconfig
