#summary omegalib Future plans for omegalib
#sidebar Sidebar

= omegalib 2.0 =

== Library Refactoring ==
Separate display and services code. 
	* `ocore` contains just input serives and basic omegalib functionality (like math & configuration support)
	* `odisplay` (or `omedia`? or just `omega`?) contains display services and the current engine
	
== New oinputserver / NetService, new protocol ==

== Refactor Event class, generic messaging support ==

== Multimachine / distributed app changes ==
	
== SAGE Integration ==
Send pixels to SAGE through SAIL. Options:
	* Integrate as separate display system (I would have to take care of doing off-axis projection and a bunch of other stuff) *NO*
	* Integrate on top of display system at:
		* omega/DisplaySystem level (more generic)
		* oengine level (allows me to use Camera / RenderPass functionality)
