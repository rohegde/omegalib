	-double click on this file to launch tracking tools

	-there are two rigid bodies in the scene:
		Glasses 	- id 1
		Hand Held 	- id 2
		**Please do not change the id's of these rigid bodies
		  without noting it here

GENERAL NOTES & COMMENTS:

	-The object ID numbers set inside of Tracking Tools are used to
	 distinguish between rigid bodies at the application level.

	-For the purposes of OpenGL the definitions of pitch, roll, and
	 yaw are as follows:
		pitch - rotation about the x-axis
		roll  - rotation about the z-axis
		yaw   - rotation about the y-axis
		*pitch and roll are switched in tracking tools
