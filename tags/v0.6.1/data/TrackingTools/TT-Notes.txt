GENERAL NOTES & COMMENTS:

	-The object ID numbers set inside of Tracking Tools are used to
	 distinguish between rigid bodies at the application level.

	-For the purposes of OpenGL the definitions of pitch, roll, and
	 yaw are as follows:
		pitch - rotation about the x-axis
		roll  - rotation about the z-axis
		yaw   - rotation about the y-axis
		*pitch and roll are switched in tracking tools
